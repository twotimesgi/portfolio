                In the summer of 2023, I was selected for both the Silicon Valley Study Tour and the Silicon Valley Fellowship. During this one-month bootcamp, I gained exclusive access to top-tier tech companies and an immersive look into the Silicon Valley startup ecosystem.

                    Out of over 700 applicants, being chosen was an exciting achievement. I was mentored by more than 20 researchers, tech managers, and venture capital executives. We visited some of the most iconic companies and universities in the Bay Areaâ€”Google, Meta, Tesla, Apple, Stanford, Berkeley, Pinterest, Cisco, PayPal, and Synopsys.
